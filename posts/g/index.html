    <p>I worked around git and learnt a few more commands. I&rsquo;ve been using git for about a week now so I&rsquo;m inculcating it more and more into my workflow each day. I used git rebase today and in the process of trying to host the hugo site, I used some new commands like submodule and a few more.</p>
<p>I think I have a better grasp of when to commit now. We had a group discussion about it and I think when to commit is quite a subjective question with an answer that would not work universally. I personally think when substantial changes are made to the file or program, we can commit our changes. Like, say I&rsquo;ve added a javascript file to my existing webpage that have HTML &amp; CSS, I would consider that a substantial change. But that is because I am the only one on that project. Someone may not consider it substantial. So when to commit is a question that everybody has their own answer to and nobody&rsquo;s answer can be considered inherently wrong.</p>
<p>Another thing we discussed is why the two step process? We use git add . and then use git commit to make a change. The two step process honestly did confuse me at first but I&rsquo;ve since learned the advantages. It helps us to commit quite a few things together and this helps keeping the project more easy to debug. If I commit for every small change I make, it would create too many logs.</p>
